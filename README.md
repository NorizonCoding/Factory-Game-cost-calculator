# Factory-Game-cost-calculator
It's a calculator for the raw material cost of items in any factory game (currently set for DSP).
The program is far from completion. Currently I have the core of the program partially finalized. (It's in the resources.py file). The main.py is a simple menu that only calculates the cost of a few resources.
This is the V1: framework version. Better, more sophisticated versions will come in the future.
